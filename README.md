## How to run the code on your PC

Open the command line in the Project folder, and put the follow commands:

-"npm install"
-"npm run start"
-"npm run build:css"

If you don't have node in you PC, you'll have to install it. The first command will make the dowload of all packages that are needed for this project. The second is a script the permits you to watch how the website looks like while you do some changes. The third one is basically to compile SASS in CSS.
